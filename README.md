four properties: an **id** (type Integer), a **name** (type String), a **Major** (type String) and
a **Grade** (type Double). Use class Student to create and object that will be read from
JavaFX screen as shown and add it into a ListView. The studentsâ€™ data in the ListView
will be automatically sorted in descending order based on the student grade. The "Student
Entry Page" will be shown when the Button "Add Student" in the "Options Page" is clicked.
